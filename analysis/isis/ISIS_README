THE PLAN:
=========

(1) isis_TBabs_diskbb.sl
Fit the data with the model "TBabs*diskbb" w/ nH free.
We discover that the best-fit nH matches the Galactic value.

(2) isis_diskbb.sl
Fit the data with the model "TBabs*diskbb" w/ nH frozen to its Galactic value.
This just shows that we still get a good fit when nH is no longer a free parameter.

(3a) isis_diskbb_powerlaw.sl
(3b) isis_diskbb_simpl.sl
(3c) isis_diskbb_compTT.sl
Incorporate a high-energy component (powerlaw, simpl, compTT) into the base model "TBabs*diskbb".
This shows that the fit is not much improved and justifies doing w/o a high-energy component.
We will need to arbitrarily choose "Index", "kT", "Gamma" for powerlaw, compTT, simpl.

(4) isis_kerrbb.sl
Fit the data with the model "TBabs*kerrbb" w/ nH frozen to its Galactic value.
All static system parameters (M, D, inc, a) are frozen to their "known" values.
The two free parameters are Mdot and fcol.

(5b) isis_kerrbb_simpl.sl <--!!! THIS STEP STILL NEEDS WORK
Incorporate a high-energy component (powerlaw, simpl, compTT) into the base model "TBabs*kerrbb".
We will need to arbitrarily choose "Gamma" for simpl.

(6) isis_mcmc_kerrbb.sl
Based on the best-fit model from (4), perform the MCMC fitting w/ the model "TBabs*kerrbb".

(7) analyze_isis_mcmc_kerrbb.py
Analyze the results from (6). Plot figures, derive best-fit parameters, etc...
