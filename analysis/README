This file outlines the procedure for producing all results relevant to two related projects on GRO J1655-40: (1) confirming the 15 degree spin-orbit misalignment by measuring the inner disk inclination angle; and (2) measuring black hole spin and f_col from disk continuum fitting.

General procedure:
